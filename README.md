Aims and Objectives.

As well as recreating the more competent styles of poker players in this project, I also aim to simulate the less successful styles such as the loose/passive and tight/passive which is often the styles of beginners, these players are sometimes called call stations or fish, the reason I would like to include these type of players is because I hope to determine which type of poker bot is best
able to exploit these weaker poker bots. 

The application should also include a feature for experimenting with these poker bots and allowing them to compete against each other. 
Poker is game that combines both skill and luck, unlike games like chess where the better player almost never loses (unless they play below their usual standards) the stronger players in poker aren't guaranteed of winning a one-off game, they do have a better chance of winning than the weaker player but due to the luck factor a weaker player can sometimes beat a stronger opponent even if the stronger player played flawlessly and the weaker player made mistakes. On the long run the better player will be more successful which is why we will need a large sample of games played between the bots to more accurately determine how well they play the game and for this reason a
feature would needed to allow games to be simulated quickly.
